# Akcesoria
This project deals with developing a Virtual website ‘Akcesoria’. It provides the user with a list of the various accessories products available for purchase in the store. For the convenience of online shopping, a shopping cart is provided to the user. After the selection of the goods, it is sent for the order confirmation process. The system is implemented using Python’s web framework Django.
